set_ctrl_state(ctl_id, state, [win_id])

     <B>Usage:</B> Controls the window control settings.  Controls really
            have two types of states, the basic enable/disable and
            an additional hide/show for temporary purposes.  There is
            no effect when you try to hide or show a control that
            is disabled.

<B>Parameters:</B> Ctl_id .int. specifies a control. State .int. is the new
            state desired.  Win_id .int. specifies a window, but is
            only used in certain situations (see below). Best to use
            the defines given in win_ctrl.h:

            CONTROLS:   CLOSE_BTN     HORZ_SCROLL     VERT_THUMB
                        ZOOM_BTN      VERT_SCROLL     HORZ_THUMB

            STATES:     ENABLE_CTRL   HIDE_CTRL       SHOW_ZOOMED
                        DISABLE_CTRL  SHOW_CTRL

            The states have the following properties:

            ENABLE_CTRL
            Enables the given control for all windows.  This is a
            "global" enable which changes every window.

            DISABLE_CTRL
            Disables the given control for all windows. This is a
            "global" disable which changes every window.

            HIDE_CTRL
            If a control is enabled, this will temporarily hide it.
            If win_id is NOT given, then all newly created
            windows will be affected (NOT the currently visible
            ones).  If win_id IS given then the control will be
            immediately hidden for that window.  You can nest
            HIDE_CTRL calls.  The manual implies that there is a
            stack for HIDE/SHOW when no win_id is given, so be sure to
            SHOW everything you HIDE.

            SHOW_CTRL
            Restores the state of controls hidden with HIDE_CTRL.
            If win_id is not given, this affects all windows.
            Remember the stack for calls without giving win_id!
            If win_id is given, that window is the only one affected.

            SHOW_ZOOMED
            Controls the ZOOMED [.] button.  After setting this, the
            button will be displayed until a non-overlapping window
            is displayed.

   <B>Returns:</B> Nothing
